// It is exported because the alternative is every consumer reimplementing it. Go forbids
// importing another module's internal packages, so while this lived in internal/harness,
// inference-sim carried a copy of the sequence and said so in a comment, and
// blis-config-search and every future backend repo would have needed their own. The
// duplication was tolerable only because it was confined to loading — but "which files a
// scenario implies" is this package's answer to give, not each caller's to guess.
//
// Every artifact is loaded through blis-schemas' own loaders. The engine rules are the ones
// the caller's Repos.Rules returns for the scenario's own engine_version, so a scenario
// pinned to an older release cannot silently get current behaviour, and a release the
// caller has no rules for is refused.

// its own settings — so a caller serving the roles separately opens one kernel per pool.
// Pricing both from pool 0 would charge the decode pool the prefill pool's parallelism, and

// identity, which the kernel deliberately does not re-export (blis-schemas#36 draws that
