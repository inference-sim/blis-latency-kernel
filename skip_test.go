// skipUntilSixteenRankAllToAllExists skips a test that can only be written against a
// 16-wide expert group, for as long as no 16-rank alltoall coefficient exists to price one.
//
// Exactly two tests need this, and both assert cross-node behaviour a narrower group
// cannot exercise: that Resolved() reports a 16-wide expert group, and that such a group
// spanning two 8-GPU nodes pays the NIC where a TP=8 reduction stays on NVLink. Every
// other test that used to ride on that fixture asserts something a measured width shows
// just as well, and uses minimax-m25-h200-ep8.yaml instead.
//
// A SKIP rather than a deletion, because the assertions are correct and wanted — it is the
// data to run them that is missing, tracked in inference-sim/blis-registry#27. A skip
// rather than a standing failure, because a permanently red suite is how a reader learns
// to stop reading failures, and that is the pathology this package has already suffered
// twice (see testdata/minimax-m25-h200-ep16.yaml's header, and the 41 tests that skipped
// for the life of the pseudo-version pin).
//
// It is CONDITIONAL ON THE REGISTRY rather than a blanket skip, and that distinction is
// the whole point. It probes for the coefficient and skips only while it is genuinely
// absent, so the day the triple lands these two tests run again with no edit here — and if
// the registry is present but unreadable, RequireArtifact fails rather than skipping. A
// skip that cannot turn itself off is the kind that hid those 41.
