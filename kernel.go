// Package latencykernel implements the blis-schemas Kernel interface: it prices GPU work
// for one resolved deployment.
//
// Construction resolves everything — catalog facts, registry coefficients, the engine
// settings a layout overrides, and the model graph flattened to a per-kind plan. After
// that every method is a pure function of its arguments, so a discrete-event simulator can
// call StepTime at any simulated instant, from any goroutine, and get the same answer.
//
// Two constructors, for the two shapes a caller comes in. Open takes a scenario filename
// and the roots its names resolve against, which is what a simulator or a scoring command
// has. New takes the documents already parsed, which is what a configuration search
// producing deployment variants that were never written to disk has. Open ends in New, so
// both validate identically and neither can price a deployment the other would refuse.
//
// Speed is a requirement rather than a nicety: a simulator calls StepTime once per
// simulated step, millions of times over a run. So the hot path does arithmetic over a
// short pre-aggregated slice and allocates little: the per-resource breakdown map, which
// StepTimeInto lets a caller reuse, and a few scratch slices that grow with the number of
// requests. The plan holds one entry per distinct layer kind rather than one per layer, which
// for the deepest model in the catalog is three entries instead of 108.

// was stated: DeepSeek-V4-Pro's csa4 layers paid 1024 + (ctx - 1024)/4 against a real

// PCP SPLITS THE PREFILL ITSELF, which is its defining purpose: vLLM calls it the "Number
// of ranks that split prefill sequence computation" (vllm/config/parallel.py:131-133 at
// v0.31.0). A rank builds a LOCAL batch of its own share and runs the forward on that
// (num_local_tokens, vllm/v1/worker/gpu/pcp_manager.py:485), so every term proportional to
// scheduled tokens falls with the split -- not only attention.
//
// THE SPLIT IS A ZIGZAG, NOT A SLICE, and that is the whole reason a single divisor is
// defensible here. _iter_rank_chunks (pcp_manager.py:235-273) cuts each prefill into
// 2*pcp chunks and gives rank r chunks r and 2*pcp-1-r, which its own docstring draws:
//
//	full:  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |     (pcp = 4)
//	rank 0:  0                           7

//	rank 2:          2           5
//	rank 3:              3   4
//
// Pairing a low chunk with a high one is what balances CAUSAL work: an early chunk has few
// keys to its left and a late one has many, and the two sum to the same total on every
// rank. Verified by enumeration: at pcp 2, 4 and 8 the per-rank causal pair counts are
// EXACTLY equal -- max over ranks divided by the ideal share is 1.000000 with zero spread
// -- for unchunked prefills and for chunked ones alike (tested at 2,048 tokens on no
// prefix, 4,096 on 8,192, 1,024 on 131,072, 8,192 on none). A plain contiguous 1/pcp slice
// would NOT balance, because the last rank would carry the whole upper triangle.
//
// THE BUSIEST RANK BINDS, as it does for DCP: the ranks must gather before the next layer,
// so the step waits for the one with the most work. Where 2*pcp divides the query every
// rank holds 2*ceil(sched/(2*pcp)) tokens and the shards sum to sched exactly; where it
// does not, the ragged remainder lands unevenly and the maximum is taken over the ranks
// rather than assumed. The overhead over a nominal sched/pcp is bounded and small at any
// realistic chunk -- under 1.5% above 1,024 tokens and under 0.4% above 4,096, for pcp up
// to 8 -- and it is an OVERSTATEMENT, which is the safe direction.

// short it is, and a rank holding no chunk simply contributes nothing.
//
// The condition itself is not "shorter than 2*pcp" either, which is the obvious guess and
// wrong: it is `(2*pcp - 1) * ceil(sched/(2*pcp)) >= sched`, which also fires at lengths
// well above 2*pcp -- at pcp 8 it is true at 17 tokens and false at 16 -- because what it

//
// THE STRIPING QUESTION, answered rather than left to omission. Tokens are striped across
// ranks in runs of `interleave` (cp_kv_cache_interleave_size, default 1), and the per-rank
// length is
//
//	base = (L / interleave / dcp) * interleave        // integer division
//	local(rank) = base + clip(L - base*dcp - rank*interleave, 0, interleave)
//
// (vllm/v1/attention/backends/utils.py:1143-1156). Rank 0 takes the largest clip, so the
// slowest rank holds base + min(L - base*dcp, interleave). Verified against the engine's
// own per-rank form over 18,000 (dcp, interleave, L) combinations: this equals the maximum
// across ranks exactly, and the shards sum to L exactly. So the interleave contributes a
// BOUNDED ADDITIVE term of at most one run, not a multiplicative one -- at interleave 32,
// dcp 8 and a 1,000-token context it is 128 against ceil(1000/8)=125, under 3%. Bounded is
// not small on a context short against the run: at interleave 64 a 100-token context puts
// 64 tokens on the slowest rank against ceil(100/8)=13, which is why the resolved interleave
// is passed in rather than assumed. At the default interleave of 1 the form reduces to
// ceil(L/dcp).
//
// PER REQUEST, not over the batch total, for the same reason selectedKVTokens is: the
// remainder term is per sequence, so sum-then-shard and shard-then-sum disagree whenever
