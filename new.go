	// The kinds are different KERNELS, not one kernel at different settings: full attention
	// reads the whole context, a sliding window reads a bounded slice of it. NVIDIA's own
	// sweeps collect them separately for that reason, and fitted separately a windowed kernel
	// sustains 1.1x to 2.8x less effective bandwidth than a full-attention one on the same
	// silicon (0.26 against 0.58 of peak on H200). Pricing both with the full-attention rate
	// makes every windowed layer too cheap, and gpt-oss-120b is half windowed layers.
	//
	// Naming follows the recurrent terms, which already carry a per-kind suffix. That is why
	// no schema change is needed: coefficient.Scope has no kind axis and does not need one.
	// MLA joins the map for the same reason SWA did: its kernel reads a different number
	// of bytes per token and sustains a different fraction of peak, so pricing it with the
	// full-attention rate is wrong by construction rather than by a little. The WIDTH comes
	// from the graph -- blis-catalog declares an MLA node with `n_kv: 1` and d_h the latent
	// width (576 = kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim for the DeepSeek-V3 family and Kimi, 512
	// for DeepSeek-V4), so a layer's NumKVHeads*HeadDim is that width --
	// and KVBytesPerToken charges it ONCE per token, since a latent cache has no value
	// tensor. The RATE is the other half: an MLA decode sustains 0.61-0.80 of datasheet
	// bandwidth against full attention's 0.52-0.88.
	//
	// The FLOOR is not what distinguishes them, which an earlier version of this comment
	// had backwards: it claimed an MLA floor "several times larger (51.5-89.5us against
	// 9.5-19.5us) because the per-call setup reads a latent cache". The registry says
	// otherwise -- attention_decode_floor_mla is 9.5-14.5us against the part-wide
	// 9.5-19.0us -- because that entry IS the part's own measured attention floor reused
	// for the kind ("this is this part's own measured attention-kernel decode floor,
	// reused for the MLA kind", cost-model-attention.yaml). The larger module-derived
	// floors, 4.7x-6.2x those, were measured and REJECTED: they cover the whole MLA block
	// including down-projections this kernel prices separately as GEMM nodes, and charging
	// them took kimi-k2.5's TPOT error from 6.38% to 14.57%.
	//
	// Nine models in the pinned catalog declare an mla or sparse_mla layer, and two of them
	// (deepseek-v4-pro, kimi-k3) appear in both the FPM dataset and the InferenceX corpus,
	// so this is on the scored path rather than hypothetical.
	//
	// sparse_mla is now mapped too, and its pair is asymmetric: the registry ships a
	// RATE and deliberately no floor.
	//
	// The reason is recorded in blis-registry scripts/fit_attention_sparse_mla.py.
	// Searching a sparse floor freely lands at 12.6-14.4us on every part -- a band that
	// does not track the part-wide floors it would replace -- and pinning it to each
	// part's own measured attention floor costs under 8% of fit. Adding the parameter
	// would re-open the failure that `attention_decode_floor_mla` shipped with: a floor
	// fitted from a MODULE table, charging projections the catalog already prices as
	// separate GEMM nodes, which cost 2.45 points of end-to-end TPOT before
	// correct_mla_floor.py undid it.
	//
	// So a kind may supply a rate alone and inherit the part-wide floor. A floor without its
	// rate is not used -- the kind is priced with the part-wide pair -- and the missing rate
	// is recorded, so the floor's listing in Provenance is not mistaken for its use.

// deployment.ValidateAgainstCluster — that a deployment's pools fill the cluster its
// scenario declares, that each local data-parallel width divides a node, that offload tiers
// draw from the declared storage inventory — and blisschemas.Validate is what supplies the
// cluster to them. Nothing ran it outside this repository's own fixture tests, so an
// external caller could build a kernel for a deployment that does not fit its hardware.
//
// THE FIELD LAYER ONLY, and that boundary is deliberate. blis-schemas separates field
// problems, which are version-independent and always the author's to fix, from
// version-scoped RULE problems, where a finding may mean the document is right and the

//     (vllm/model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer.py:363-381, 279-297;

//     dummy run proposes in that lane (gpu/model_runner.py:888-913), so its window-only
//     layers' request is held beside the target's rather than inside it;
//   - the indexer's stand-in for its logits, a transient of 512 MiB at the profile peak
//     (sparse_attn_indexer.py:383-388);
//   - the indexers' shared top-k buffer, max_num_batched_tokens x index_topk int32
//     (nvidia/model.py:656-660), and DSpark's own while it speculates (nvidia/dspark.py:
//     110-114);
//   - the candidate-block buffer, where a layer publishes candidates (model.py:665-675);
//   - the drafter's hidden-state buffer, max_num_batched_tokens x hc_mult x hidden_size in
//     the model dtype, whenever the deployment speculates, as DSpark is an EAGLE-family
//     method (model.py:773-784; use_eagle, vllm/config/speculative.py:1938-1942).
