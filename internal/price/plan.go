// A Plan is a model graph collapsed for repeated evaluation.
//
// Step time is the hot path: a discrete-event simulator calls it once per simulated step,
// which is millions of times over a run. So the graph is flattened once, at construction,
// into the smallest form that still prices correctly — and after that a step costs
// arithmetic over a short slice with no map lookups, no string comparisons and no
// allocation.
//
// Three things make that possible.
//
// The stack collapses to a per-kind layer COUNT rather than a layer list. A 108-layer
// hybrid has three distinct kinds, so a step walks three entries and multiplies, not 108.
// Across the twenty-four models in the catalog that is 1436 layers against 38 distinct
// kinds: a 37x reduction in per-step work, and it is why the graph's compression is a
// storage choice rather than a speed one.
//
// Conditional nodes are resolved out. Whether a collective runs depends on the layout,
// which is fixed at construction, so a plan contains only the nodes that will actually
// execute. No condition is evaluated per step.
//
// Shape-dependent work is separated from shape-independent work. Weight bytes and expert
// counts do not vary with the batch, so they are summed once into scalars. Only the terms
// that depend on token counts are recomputed.
