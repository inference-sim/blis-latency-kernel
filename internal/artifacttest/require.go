// RequireArtifact reports a failure to load a catalog or registry artifact as either a
// skip or a test failure, depending on which of the two it actually is.
//
// A sibling checkout that is NOT THERE skips: not every working copy has an upstream
// blis-catalog or blis-registry beside it, and a test cannot read what is absent. An
// artifact that IS there and still failed to load FAILS, because that is an
// incompatibility between this repository and that one — and a blanket skip over it is
// how one hid for the whole life of a dependency pin.
//
// The history is specific. blis-catalog had already moved to blis-schemas v0.2.0 field
// names (read_bandwidth_mb_s) that the pseudo-version this repo was pinned to rejected, so
// every test building a kernel from a committed fixture skipped on "catalog unavailable"
// -- 41 of them -- and three commands exited 1 against the real catalog. A skip reads as a
// pass, so the suite was green by not running. The fixture
// testdata/minimax-m25-h200-ep16.yaml records a PRIOR occurrence of the same pathology, so
// it is this repository's recurring failure mode rather than a one-off.
//
// In an ordinary file of this leaf package rather than a _test.go one, so other packages'
// tests can call it; it is compiled into any binary that imports artifacttest, which is
// why it takes a testing.TB rather than reaching for os.Exit.
//
// Lives here, exported, rather than in each test package, because the first fix of this
// applied the rule to one package of three and left cmd/shape and cmd/score masking the
// same corruption under an "ok".
//
// root is the catalog or registry root being read; path is the specific artifact whose
// load failed, which is what gets stat'ed -- a root that exists tells you nothing about a
// file inside it that does not.
