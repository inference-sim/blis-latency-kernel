// A disaggregated deployment: a prefill pool and a decode pool on one two-node cluster,
// differing in the parallelism that sets step time. Written to a temp dir rather than
// committed under testdata, because nothing else in this repository prices a disaggregated
// deployment and a committed fixture would be dead weight the fixture-contract tests then
// have to carry.
//
// The two pools differ in tensor-parallel width (8 against 4) specifically so a test can
// tell which one was priced: if OpenPool ignored its index, both kernels would resolve the
// same layout and the assertion below could not fail.
