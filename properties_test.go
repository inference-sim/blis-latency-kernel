// Properties that must hold for EVERY deployment the catalog can price, checked across a
// spread of batch shapes rather than on one fixture at one shape.
//
// These are metamorphic and invariant tests: they relate one call's output to another's
// without knowing either absolute value. That is the only kind of assertion available here
// — the right step time for a deployment is an empirical question answered by the scoring
// corpora, not by a unit test — and it is the kind that survives a recoefficienting. A test
// pinning a microsecond figure breaks whenever the registry is refitted and tells you
// nothing about whether the model still behaves like a cost model.
//
// They complement methods_test.go, whose assertions are pinned to one fixture. A term that
// is wired up correctly for minimax-m2.5 on H200 and wrong for a dense model on one GPU
// passes there and fails here.

// propertyFixtures are deployments spanning the shapes that change which terms fire:
// dense vs MoE, expert-parallel vs tensor-parallel only, single- vs multi-node, a
// recurrent stack, and speculative decoding.
//
// Named rather than discovered so the list is reviewable, and kept small because each
// builds a kernel against the real catalog.
