"""Write the direct corpus in harness.LoadCorpus's own format, so the existing scorer
reads it with no new scoring code.

# What this file carries, and what it deliberately omits

`metricscore` computes mape from the absolutes file -- predicted over measured at every
point, the anchor included -- and shape from this file's relatives, each side divided by
its own value at the sweep's lowest concurrency. So a corpus file needs the relatives, and
they are computable here because the absolutes are known: a point's relative is its
absolute over the absolute at the anchor.

The AISimulate and AIC prediction fields are written as 0, which the scorer reads as "not
published". That is a finding rather than an omission.

An artifact prediction exists per (model, gpu, precision, framework, workload, tp,
concurrency). This corpus keys a deployment additionally on the container image and on what
the run's args line states, because both change the measurement. Only 38 of the 3,345
points map one-to-one onto an artifact prediction; the rest share one across up to 14
distinct deployments. On deepseek-v4-pro h200 fp8 8k1k tp8 at concurrency 64, fourteen
deployments spanning 2.49x in measured TPOT -- differing in image and in expert- and
attention-parallel width -- all collapse onto a single artifact key. An AISimulate column
built on that reuse would compare one prediction against fourteen different deployments,
which is the conflation this corpus exists to avoid.

So this table is the kernel against InferenceX's own measurement, and the estimator
comparison stays in the artifact-based tables, where every arm predicts the same
artifact-defined deployment.
