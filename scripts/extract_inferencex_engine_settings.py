"""Extract the ENGINE SETTINGS each measured run was launched with, from InferenceX's dump.

# Why a lookup and not a rule

The accuracy snapshot publishes a deployment's parallelism and precision and nothing about
how its engine was configured, so scripts/gen_aisimulate_scenarios.py wrote a default and
said so: "max_num_seqs, block_size, gpu_memory_utilization and cudagraph_mode are engine
defaults: the comparison scores a ratio across concurrency at a fixed deployment, so a
constant cancels."

A constant does cancel in a step-time ratio. It does not cancel when it decides WHETHER A
REQUEST WAITS, which is what the sequence cap does, and time to first token is mostly made of
waiting. Measured against the 46 vLLM sweeps this corpus scores, the assumed 256 was wrong on
every chip.

No rule replaces it either. Reading what the runs actually passed shows three regimes in
roughly equal measure across 254 points: max_num_seqs equal to the client concurrency (92),
a fixed 512 (69), and not passed at all (93). Any single rule is wrong on two thirds of the
corpus. So this reads the value per point.

# Where the settings come from

Every vLLM server log opens with a `non-default args` line listing exactly what was passed on
the command line, and later reports what the engine RESOLVED. Both are captured:

    non-default args: {'model': ..., 'max_model_len': 9416, 'max_num_seqs': 32,
                       'max_num_batched_tokens': 8192, 'enable_prefix_caching': False, ...}
    GPU KV cache size: 6,161,456 tokens
    Maximum concurrency for 9,416 tokens per request: 693.86x

A setting absent from the args line was not passed, and the engine resolved it from device
memory (vllm/engine/arg_utils.py get_batch_defaults). That absence is recorded as null rather
than filled in here, so a consumer can apply the engine's own resolution and a reader can tell
a measurement from a default.

# The join, and the check that validates it

The run a sweep is scored against is already settled: testdata/measurements/
inferencex_absolutes.json records the (date, config_id) whose relatives reproduce the
artifact's own, for all 83 sweeps at 0.000%. This script reuses that decision rather than
re-deriving it, so the settings and the latencies cannot come from different runs -- which is
the failure that would make the comparison quietly stop being apples to apples.

Requires the InferenceX dump restored locally (benchmark_results, configs, server_logs).

Usage:
    python scripts/extract_inferencex_engine_settings.py \
        -c testdata/measurements/aisimulate_e2e.json \
        -a testdata/measurements/inferencex_absolutes.json \
