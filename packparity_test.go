// The packs this kernel reads are, byte for byte, the ones it read before they moved. The
// test downloads the former release (go mod download, which checks it against the checksum
// database and against formerRulesPinSum here) and compares each v0.29.0 and v0.31.0 pack.go
// with the one the kernel builds against today. The move rewrote exactly two things, which the
// comparison undoes and nothing else: a four-line provenance header, and the import of
// blis-schemas' internal validate package as the exported rules.Problems alias. One later
// rewrite is undone too, exactly once per pack: the capture-size check passes the engine-neutral
// rules.CUDAGraphCaptureInput built from the four fields CUDAGraphCaptureSizes reads, where it
// passed the whole engine block (blis-vllm 480d434, with blis-schemas#102 ddfd45b). Any other
// difference, one byte, fails, however the kernel's tests price.
